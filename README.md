# CrateCreator2
This is a Java Desktop Application to create crates easily for CrazyCrates plugin.

It's initially made for personal usage so it's not well documented. You can open issue if you need help.

# Usage
- You need to build this project with spigot.jar. I couldn't include that because of legal reasons.  
- Create a folder named **db** in the directory of the newly built JAR.
- Create a file named kasa.yml. And then fill it with your default crate.yml from CrazyCrates. Only remove the **Prizes* part.
- Run the program and add RRL's. RRL means Real Rarity Level. It needs a rarity level and chance. 
- Add items. This is where RRL makes sense. You can add unlimited items to a RRL and this program will automatically set chances to each item depending on the RRL. For example if you add a RRL named Rare with 20 chance. And add 10 items to this RRL. This means every item will have %2 chance.
- Bake config.

It was really useful back when I worked with CrazyCrates. I hope it can be useful for you as well. Have fun and don't hesitate to ask any questions.
